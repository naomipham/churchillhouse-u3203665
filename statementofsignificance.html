            <p>
                Churchill House is a good example of the Late Twentieth Century Brutalist style, (1960-), displaying several key features as follows:
            </p>
            
                <div class="dotpoint">
                    <p>Large areas of blank wall, especially the west wall of the south wing.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="dotpoint">
                    <p>Off-form concrete, such as the west wall of the south wing and the spandrels to the south and east wings.</p>
                </div>

            <p>
                In addition, it displays a number of the other features of this style including: sloping structural fins, precast concrete non-loadbearing wall panels, precast fins for sun protection, and vertical slit windows. Churchill House is one of several Canberra examples of this style, and one of only two which display a restrained form reflecting, perhaps, a more conservative approach to the style because of the intended office use.

                The architecture of this building may contribute to the education of designers in their understanding of Late Twentieth-Century Architectural Styles.

                Churchill House has interest for its association with the prominent architect, Robin Boyd. The building was his last major commission.
